## ✨ What I Learned

Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- Creating responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid.
- Styling circular profile images using border-radius and object-fit.
- Applying Mobile First design principles.

🧩 Example of code I'm proud of:

```html
<img class="profile-image" src="your-image.jpg" alt="Profile picture">
css
Copiar
Editar
.profile-image {
  width: 96px;
  height: 96px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
  border: 5px solid white;
}
🔄 Continued Development
Areas I plan to improve in future projects:

Enhancing responsiveness on very small devices (below 320px width)

Improving accessibility (ARIA tags, color contrast)

Adding smooth animations for hover effects and transitions
